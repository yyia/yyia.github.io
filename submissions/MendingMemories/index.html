                                            Mending, from an outside perspective, may not seem to warrant much thought
                                            or importance. A beloved old skirt gets some wear and tear, giving people
                                            who can sew the opportunity to use their skills, while those clueless about
                                            the world of mending send their garments to the nearest seamstress or dry
                                            cleaner at a low cost. To the menders, this delegation seems like a
                                            loss—mending a garment is an intimate experience, and to mend one’s own
                                            clothing may be the closest a person can get to mending their own body and
                                            mind. In Dóra Pétursdóttir and Bjørnar Olsen’s text “An Archaeology of
                                            Ruins,” the everyday wrinkles and tears found in clothing are called
                                            “memories,” a term originally used by nineteenth century
                                            tailors.<sup>1</sup> The
                                            intimacy of one’s clothing is exemplified by Jonathan Senchyne’s text
                                            “Vibrant Material Textuality: New Materialism, Book History, and the Archive
                                            in Paper,”<sup>2</sup> wherein the scholar reveals that rags which have
                                            sustained
                                            “intimate contact”<sup>3</sup> with young women’s bodies have romantic
                                            potential, as
                                            they capture their owner’s essence. The idea of mending as care, extending
                                            to self-care and self-mending for the purpose of this essay, is put forth by
                                            Maria Puig de la Bellacasa in her <i>Matters of Care: Speculative Ethics in
                                                More than Human Worlds.</i><sup>4</sup> I will apply Bellacasa’s
                                            concepts to
                                            Frida
                                            Kahlo’s well-loved clothing, as evidenced by its many
                                            “memories,”<sup>5</sup>
                                            examined with the visual aids of Miyajo Ishiuchi’s book of photographs,
                                            <i>Frida by Ishiuchi</i>.<sup>6</sup> Famed for her work surrounding
                                            bodily
                                            scars, Ishiuchi
                                            extends the idea that a scar captures a moment in life, like a photograph,
                                            to the apparent signs of mending and wear on Kahlo’s clothing. Kahlo’s
                                            eclectic and memory-filled wardrobe conveys a great deal about her—her
                                            cultural influences, the kind of person as whom she wished to be perceived,
                                            the way she moved while wearing the clothes (through her “memories”), and
                                            her corporeal issues. Through these images, the viewer learns what Frida
                                            wished to construct or conceal from the outside world.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Kahlo’s wardrobe was locked away for fifty years in a bathroom in her home,
                                            the Casa Azul, under the request of her partner, Diego Rivera. Those who
                                            unearthed this trove described it in haptic language: “Perhaps some curious
                                            alchemy of cosmetic powders, pharmaceutical chemicals, and humidity, despite
                                            creating a strange smell, […] protected this magnificent
                                            legacy.”<sup>7</sup>
                                            Michelle McVicker, Current Collections and Education Assistant in the Museum
                                            at FIT, spoke in her colloquium, “‘The Traces of Use:’ the Dresses of Frida
                                            Kahlo” <sup>8</sup>. She addressed the physical state of Kahlo’s clothing
                                            when they
                                            were rediscovered. McVicker describes Kahlo’s “memories” as follows: “Paint
                                            stains [where she lay her palette while painting in her lap], cigarette
                                            burns, mending done by Kahlo […] or at her bidding. [Unprotected garments
                                            had] stains from paint and medicine as well as fading” <sup>9</sup> (fig.
                                            1).
                                            These
                                            descriptions are novelistic and romantic. Clothing is fundamental to the
                                            Romantic style, which can be defined as heightened emotion and intimacy in
                                            literature and art. Jonathan Senchyne discusses the romance of rags,
                                            expressing that, “[t]he handkerchief becomes soiled and worn through contact
                                            with the intimate parts of the woman’s body. [By carrying its residue,]
                                            ragged cloth has a certain force. [This] intimate relation to her body
                                            dictates similarly intimate things, like a lover’s note.”<sup>10</sup>
                                            This is
                                            indicated to the viewer not only in Kahlo’s wardrobe, but in her painting
                                            <i>Self Portrait with Cropped Hair</i> (fig. 2), in which she wears Rivera’s
                                            suit.
                                            The artist’s understanding of clothing as intimate to the body extends to
                                            her treatment of her own clothing, and therefore her self-presentation.

                                            Nietzsche was beloved by Kahlo in her lifetime, influencing her in more ways
                                            than solely intellectually. He wrote that one created oneself throughout
                                            one’s whole life.<sup>11</sup> Kahlo did this by creating her own persona
                                            through her
                                            costumes and feigned energetic spirit, despite her tiring
                                            illnesses.<sup>12</sup> The
                                            concept of self-creation is tied to that of self-mending. Kahlo was in pain
                                            corporeally and mentally due to her chronic illnesses and frequent
                                            surgeries; her body was often in tatters, and in many of her paintings she
                                            is pierced like a pincushion, bleeding, or otherwise eternally pained,
                                            ripped apart like a bad sewing project. The mending performed on her
                                            clothes, which appears amateurish, was likely Kahlo’s own work. In <i>Detail
                                                of
                                                Mended Corset and Skirt</i> (fig. 2), these imperfectly spaced,
                                            haphazardly
                                            basted stitches are “memories” in and of themselves. They are Kahlo’s
                                            metaphorical fingerprint, remnants of the contact she had with the garments.
                                            The garments are relics of Kahlo’s spirit, and they reveal a
                                            will to mend.
                                            Kahlo was often in pain, but she soldiered on, and with style. The detail
                                            and care given to her clothing becomes the care she gives to herself; she
                                            creates herself elaborately. Her clothing represents her cultural influences
                                            and her anti-capitalist values as she mixed and matched her outfits “to her
                                            own tastes,” <sup>13</sup> not following one culture’s set of rules. For

                                            Kahlo’s use of local fabrics with a coded, rich history, incorporating a
                                            European silhouetted top with its high neckline and puffed sleeves, paired
                                            with this hybrid European-Mexican skirt is Kahlo. The motif of flouncing is
                                            featured on the breast of the blouse, the cuffs of the sleeves, the pockets,
                                            and hem of the skirt, creating a continuity within the outfit. She unifies
                                            her influences and values by combining them into one outfit, and thus into
                                            one “self.” Her desire to be situated within Indigenous Mexican culture,
                                            from which she felt alienated partly due to her half-European background, is
                                            evident in her use of this fabric, yet she does not erase her European
                                            influences, as can be seen in the European elements of this dress (fig. 3).
                                            Diego Rivera heavily encouraged Kahlo to wear traditional Mexican clothing.
                                            When she and Rivera divorced, she returned to wearing the exclusively
                                            European clothing of her youth. She cut her long hair short, as long hair is
                                            traditional for women in several indigenous Mexican cultures. In these ways,
                                            Kahlo erased the image of herself that Rivera loved. The ruthless
                                            manipulation of her self-presentation through her wardrobe and cosmetic
                                            choices show that she was equipped equally to self-create and self-destroy,
                                            repeatedly altering her fabricated self according to her circumstances.

                                        <p>The act of sewing is inherently violent: it involves cutting,
                                            ripping, and
                                            stabbing with needles.
                                            The undertaking of a sewing project involves both
                                            destruction and creativity to an extent other aesthetic pursuits do not
                                            match. People wear clothing every day—resting right against their bodies
                                            like extensions of themselves, often displaying values or social class.
                                            Violence is equally a part of life, particularly for women. The fact that
                                            sewing is traditionally considered women’s work is interesting in this
                                            respect—women are historically valued as creators of life, and this concept
                                            was present and in Kahlo’s mind. Symbols of the Aztec goddess Coatlicue, who
                                            is associated with birth, violence, sacrifice, and death are often seen in
                                            Kahlo’s works along with depictions of Kahlo’s own struggles with these
                                            concepts. <sup>15</sup> Many are also likely predestined to other pains
                                            such as
                                            physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Sewing is often dismissed as
                                            feminine, unthreatening, gentle work. This erases the fact that the violence
                                            inherent in its process adds to the complexity of the task. In many of her
                                            paintings, Kahlo depicts the stabbing and piercing of her flesh.<i> Tree of
                                                Hope, Remain Strong</i> (fig. 4) illustrates the similarities between
                                            sewing and
                                            surgical suturing. Her exposed back lacerations could be mended, rejoining
                                            her flesh by sewing her back up. This surgery was intended to help her, but
                                            was bloody and violent all the same.

                                            In her life, Kahlo presented herself bursting with vitality with vibrantly
                                            coloured cosmetics, ribbons, and clothing, seeming unabashed. When one
                                            compares this version of Kahlo to those in her paintings—in which she is
                                            exposed, victim, empty of facial expression, parts of her body gory and nude
                                            <sup>16</sup>—Kahlo’s “pieces” can be hard to negotiate into a cohesive
                                            whole. She is
                                            complex and meticulous in her representation of both types of works; in her
                                            paintings, much attention is paid to her aesthetics in keeping with her
                                            everyday looks, though they are rarely the focus of the painting unless they
                                            are symbolic. In <i>Memory of the Heart</i> (fig. 5) Kahlo is flanked by the
                                            school
                                            clothes she wore as a child in a European-style school, as well as the
                                            traditional Mexican clothing she wore as an adult. These garments are
                                            symbolic of her past iterations. Kahlo depicts herself as impaled and
                                            injured (fig. 5), figuratively stringing up her fragmented past identities
                                            through clothing. Each outfit represents her past and only links arms with
                                            her through a single arm projecting out of each sleeve. Her past bodies,
                                            represented by arms, can only attach to her present one and be “fleshed out”
                                            through the clothing itself. It is as if her past iterations are only
                                            identifiable through what she wore. Her body is a fragment of her past while
                                            her clothes remain whole, like a vivid memory, her past body a ruin.

                                            Kahlo’s choice of aesthetics was a performance which was often
                                            appropriative. Her use of Indigenous Mexican clothing was not authentic, as
                                            the artist herself stated, “I’ve never been to Tehuantepec…nor do I have any
                                            connections to the town, but of all Mexican costumes this is the one I like
                                            the best [and most frequently worn].” <sup>17</sup> In saying “This is the
                                            one I like
                                            the best,” she shows a clear fondness for the clothes. These aesthetics
                                            became her truth through repetition, whether she had a right to do so or
                                            not. Despite it not being culturally authentic to her in her time, it was
                                            incontestably a fundamental aspect of her representation.

                                            A person’s wardrobe is extremely telling of who they are—it reflects their
                                            personal and cultural values, place in society, and their aesthetic
                                            preferences. Kahlo’s self-creation through her clothing choices is in
                                            keeping with the values she wished to project: vitality, vivacity, diverse
                                            cultural influences, and unique beauty. The intimate nature of the clothes
                                            she left behind show her “memories” through a paint stain, cigarette burn,
                                            or through mending performed by the artist herself. Kahlo self-creates and
                                            self-mends through her clothing, doctoring together a ubiquitous identity,
                                            unifying herself through her physical representation. The act of sewing thus
                                            remains both as violent and creative as we can understand Frida Kahlo’s life
                                            to have been.
