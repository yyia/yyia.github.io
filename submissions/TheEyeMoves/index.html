                                            Even before Laura Mulvey first theorized about the power dynamics of the
                                            gaze in “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,” people have struggled with
                                            the uneasy mediation of cinematic mediums between the eye and the body. Too
                                            often, film theorists treat the gaze as a detached and purely intellectual
                                            apparatus of the body. This way of thinking ignores the visceral sensory
                                            effect in the body that comes with looking, as well as the way that
                                            representational technologies “convey their logic…through the manner in
                                            which they latently engage our bodies.” <sup>1</sup> No genre of film
                                            shows this
                                            phenomenon more clearly than the pornographic image, a “dense semantic
                                            site...which functions only in and through a direct visceral appeal to the
                                            body.” <sup>2</sup>
                                        </p><br>

                                            The relationship between the gazed-upon body and the spectator (and their
                                            own body) was a core concept for the 1960s Western avant-garde in
                                            performance art and experimental cinema. In her essay on Andy Warhol’s
                                            erotically evasive film <i>Blow Job</i>, Ara Osterwell describes how
                                            “despite their
                                            shared investment in corporeality, pornography and the avant-garde are often
                                            positioned at odds.” <sup>3</sup> While part of this disparity comes from
                                            porn and
                                            experimental cinema’s vastly different formal vocabularies, I also believe
                                            that the extreme lack of critical attention given to pornography is directly
                                            correlated with larger societal devaluation of sexual labour, in both its
                                            products and its creators. Today’s porn market is moving continually away
                                            from centralized models of production, with more space for sex workers to
                                            produce their own content on their own terms. Four Chambers, a collective of
                                            porn producers and performers headed by British former art photographer Vex
                                            Ashley, is an example of what sort of creative possibilities are opening up
                                            in this decentralized market. By embedding art-historical concepts and
                                            avant-garde cinematic techniques into graphic depictions of bodies fucking,
                                            Four Chambers’ work attempts to dissolve the polarization of art and
                                            pornography into their shared pleasure in looking, while simultaneously
                                            exposing the ways a spectator’s perceptions of high and low taste are very
                                            much informed by the medium and market context wherein work is embedded.

                                            Four Chambers’ work is featured exclusively on the collective’s website, A
                                            Four Chambered Heart, where full versions of its films are only accessible
                                            to viewers who are paid subscribers to the project on Patreon. Modelled
                                            after the painterly tradition of artistic ‘patronage,’ Patreon is an online
                                            crowdfunding platform that enables people to support an artist’s practice on
                                            an ongoing basis. In Four Chambers’ case, individual viewers pay nine
                                            dollars toward each video they make, in exchange for exclusive access to the
                                            full, explicit versions of the work. At the height of their success, the
                                            collective was receiving a total of $1,3796 per video from this platform.
                                            <sup>4</sup> This level of success in the highly saturated internet porn
                                            market has
                                            been established almost entirely through Four Chambers’ and Ashley’s own
                                            formidable social media presence, concentrated in the image-oriented
                                            platforms of Tumblr and Instagram. <sup>5</sup> There, soft-lit, highly
                                            stylized, and
                                            filtered images of silky bodies dominate, with crescent moon forms artfully
                                            concealing errant nipples and bushes (fig. 1).

                                            This strategic tease— stunningly beautiful, mysterious images coupled with
                                            the total exclusivity of content –– has led to the creation of a kind of
                                            mythos surrounding the work. In the past several years, Four Chambers has
                                            gathered quite a bit of attention in the mainstream press, turning Ashley
                                            into somewhat of a symbolic figurehead in the ongoing dialogue around
                                            “feminist,” “ethical,” or “aesthetic” pornography. An article for <i>ELLE
                                                Magazine</i> begins by stating that “it's easy to see why [Ashley]...is
                                            often
                                            labelled a ‘tasteful’ porn star.” <sup>6</sup> There is an unmistakable
                                            polish and
                                            sophistication in their films, harkening more to the world of high-art
                                            cinema than to the hard-core aesthetic many associate with the term
                                            “pornography.” Ashley described the style to <i>Dazed Magazine</i> as
                                            “magical
                                            realism porn,” chalking the literary theory, art history and fiction

                                            Chambers’ work does overtly reference a vast array of visual media, with
                                            influences ranging from Caravaggio to David Cronenberg to Carolee
                                            Schneemann. <sup>8</sup> Schneemann in particular makes for an interesting
                                            comparison, as she too worked as both the directing eye and the performing
                                            body in her images, though on the opposing side of the art-pornography
                                            divide.

                                            Between 1964 and 1967, visual artist Carolee Schneemann was experimenting
                                            with how to transfer her practice from abstract painting to other media, and
                                            decided to make her own erotic film, <i>Fuses</i>. She felt that “no one had
                                            dealt
                                            with the images of lovemaking as a core of spontaneous gesture and
                                            movement,” <sup>9</sup> and considered the exploration of sexual images
                                            from a
                                            distinctly feminine subjectivity as a great opportunity. Schneemann shot the
                                            film herself with her partner James Tenney, partly to investigate whether or
                                            not “a nude woman artist [could] be both image and image maker.”
                                            <sup>10</sup> For
                                            someone hoping to get a clear view of the sexual action, however,
                                            <i>Fuses</i> is a
                                            disorienting experience. The filmstrips are tinted vivid teal, magenta, and
                                            amber hues, with heavy layers of collage muddying the image underneath.
                                            Though Schneemann originally screened the film in progress to fellow artists
                                            in New York, she was often met with antagonistic responses to the work, with
                                            some of her peers dismissing it as “narcissistic exhibitionism.”
                                            <sup>11</sup> It
                                            seemed that at the time, the project was too pornographic for the
                                            experimental film scene, yet it was also too boring for those hoping to “get
                                            off.” So much of <i>Fuses</i> revolves around fragmentation: Schneemann says
                                            she
                                            wanted the viewer to “get lost in the frame— to move the body in and out of
                                            its own frame, to move the eye in and out of the body so it could see
                                            everything it wanted to.” <sup>12</sup> This method stands in direct
                                            contrast to
                                            hard-core pornography’s stylistic insistence on “the genital event as the
                                            norm of sexuality, within a time frame that avoids unnecessarily lingering
                                            over ‘irrelevant’ spaces of the body.” <sup>13</sup>

                                            Andy Warhol’s <i>Blow Job</i>, created in 1963 just before <i>Fuses</i>,
                                            takes this
                                            “irrelevant” lingering to its logical conclusion by eliminating the genital
                                            image entirely. In twenty-seven minutes of complete silence, the film
                                            remains on a steady close-up of an anonymous man’s face, who is ostensibly
                                            responding to the action described in the film’s title (fig. 2). Left
                                            without sound
                                            and with only a short fragment of the body, the man’s frequent lurches,
                                            sighs, and pouts are “situated in an illegible visual lexicon where meaning
                                            has become inaccessible.” <sup>14</sup> By choosing to light his face from
                                            above,
                                            turning his face hollow and skull-like, Warhol “succeeds in making the
                                            representation of the sexual act strange.” <sup>15</sup> Like Schneemann,
                                            Warhol
                                            screened the film primarily to other New York artists, but strategically
                                            presented it for the first time in the cultural sanctity of an art gallery,
                                            to dedicate the piece to the high-art canon, rather than the midnight peep
                                            show crowd. Although experimental filmmakers were interested in putting
                                            sexual content into their works, they remained afraid of contaminating their
                                            art with pornography and its associated social stigma. This fear remains
                                            relevant today, allowing an interesting dynamic to arise: if art has
                                            everything to lose by becoming pornographic, what does
                                            pornography
                                            have to

                                            In “The Metaphor of the Eye,” Roland Barthes critically analyzes French
                                            surrealist Georges Bataille’s famed work of pornographic fiction <i>The
                                                Story
                                                of the Eye</i>, stating that, “there is nothing more limited than erotic
                                            material. Yet they are sufficiently numerous to lend themselves’ to
                                            apparently infinite combinations.” <sup>16</sup> The limitation inherent
                                            in dealing
                                            exclusively with sexual content is something that Bataille attempts to
                                            subvert through a chain of linking and overlapping metaphors that run
                                            undercurrent to the rapidly escalating sexual perversions of the central
                                            characters within the novella. Its central motif, the eye, is transformed
                                            into different objects in a globular relationship to it: the egg, the sun,
                                            and the testicles. <sup>17</sup> From this circle of metaphors, “a second
                                            chain
                                            springs from it, made up of all the avatars of liquid.” <sup>18</sup> By
                                            then
                                            blurring together these metaphors with uneasy phrases like “urinary
                                            liquefaction of the sky,” <sup>19</sup> the author succeeds in once again
                                            making sex
                                            appear strange.

                                            titled <i>The Eye</i>, Vex Ashley creates a nonlinear narrative that
                                            incorporates
                                            many objects from Bataille’s metaphoric chain, while using techniques
                                            particular to avant-garde filmmakers such as Schneemann and Warhol. The film
                                            opens with a shifting narrow viewpoint that mobilizes both the eye of the
                                            viewer and the one pictured. Almost every shot is staged in close-up,
                                            focusing on the performers watching each other, well, perform (fig. 3).

                                            The more I compared <i>ELLE Magazine</i>’s discussion of Four Chambers’ work
                                            to the
                                            art itself, the more I wondered if we were looking at the same thing. Had
                                            the film been presented in a gallery context, it would have been seen as
                                            fetishistic, perverse, and preceded by many layers of content warnings, but
                                            it would have also opened the work up to the possibility of deeper
                                            subtextual analysis than the internet porn market will afford it now. It is
                                            astounding how arbitrarily people will label these kind of works as either
                                            “good,” “ethical,” and “feminist” or “bad,” “evil,” and “corrupt” as though
                                            its designation as porn somehow flattens all of its complexities into a
                                            division of “low art” and “aspirational high art.”

                                            The internet and social media have brought about a period of unprecedented
                                            growth in pornography that is directed, performed and produced by sex
                                            workers themselves. The ingenuity, resourcefulness, and nerve evident in
                                            pornographers such as Vex Ashley can be recognized as fulfilling
                                            Schneemann’s dream of the artist as both image and image-maker, yet their
                                            work remains on the margins of the art world due to pervasive forces of
                                            misrepresentation, censorship, and stigma. Throughout history, sex workers
                                            have been caught in this uneasy mediation: torn between catering
                                            to
                                            the
                                            visual pleasure of their audiences and maintaining a sense of
                                            agency
                                            in a
                                            world that stigmatizes and dismisses their work.
                                            Sex workers deserve a
                                            deeper level of inclusion in the discourse around sexuality in art, and if
                                            things continue the way artists like Four Chambers have indicated, are going
                                            to continue to demand it.

                                                This paper was first written in 2016, and in many ways, it reflects an
                                                era of sex worker-led online community that is now rapidly disappearing
                                                due to new laws and corporate policy restricting sexual content on the
                                                internet. FOSTA and SESTA are pieces of American legislation, enacted in
                                                2018, that criminalize all websites that host content that can be
                                                interpreted as facilitating sex work. This includes advertising
                                                platforms, many forms of adult content, and even sex worker community
                                                support spaces on social media.
                                                Because major websites that host user-created content are the most
                                                targeted by FOSTA/SESTA, it has started a wave of companies censoring
                                                their own users through restrictive terms of service that essentially
                                                ban sex workers from their platforms. Since this essay was written, Four
                                                Chambers has been banned and erased from sites like Patreon and Tumblr.
                                                The collective was forced to create their own structures for
                                                subscription and hosting content, but it still survives today, likely
                                                thanks to their large following and their perception by many as being
                                                “not-like-other-pornographers.” Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many sex
                                                workers have been forced to shift their work online, where they now face
                                                increasing restrictions from social media sites, website hosting
                                                platforms, and online banking providers like PayPal.
                                                It is arguably more important than ever for audiences to be critical of
                                                reductive analyses of sexual media. As artists and audiences who harbour
                                                an investment in the ethics of sexual labour and expression, it is
                                                important for us to foreground the experiences of sex workers who are
                                                currently most affected by this censorship, and stand in solidarity with
                                                their struggle against the state and corporations that undermine our
                                                right to a free and safe Internet for all.
